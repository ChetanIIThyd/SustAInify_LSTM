# Multi-Objective Optimization of Energy Procurement with LSTM-based Price Prediction

# Project Overview and Problem Statement
 Steel Manufacturing Company operates a plant in Europe,requiring an electricity supply of 1,200 MWh/Day to maintainitsoperations.This demand is met through a combination of sourcing from the State Electricity Grid, State Power Exchange, and the company's own captive solar power plant.
 The company aims to balance its electricity procurement costs with its environmental impact, particularly focusing on carbon footprint while ensuring a minimum of 20% renewable energy utilisation in its energy mix.
1) To predict daily average electricity prices at the Power Exchange based on historical data from 2010â€“2017.
2) To optimize procurement costs for 2018 while ensuring a minimum 20% renewable energy in the total energy mix and tracking carbon footprint.
